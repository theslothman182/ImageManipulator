# ImageManipulator
This is code for an Image Manipulator program, C++
I completed this project for my advanced Object Oriented programming module in my third year at university.

The code is split into two projects, "ImageManipulator" and "Image".

"ImageManipulator" is the actual program UI which uses an MVC architecture, which also handle the manipulation of the images.
Whereas, "Image" is the part of the program which is responsible for finding and retrieving the images in a stored location.
